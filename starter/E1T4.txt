Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
Currently, IAM Role is being set up with full access to AWS S3 Bucket Service so that it indirectly give some vulnerability and data breach in application and resources. 
Instead of, IAM Role should be set up and configured with some previlege principle and it will also dependence on duty of each user and/or group user in that.

# Poor practice 2
WebAppSG Security Group is being set up and configured with full access for Ingress & Egress traffic. Ingress traffic should be configured to limit access system from the out side system or Internet.
And it's also configured access right based on the duty of user and/or group user. Egress traffic should be set up with the right way to protect system. 
Above thing will makes system/server reduce expose vulnerability security, data breach and makes hacker has little opportunity attack to system. Pay attention on port range 0 - 65535. Especially, port 22, 80, 5000
