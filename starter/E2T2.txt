Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

1. IAM policy is not following the principle of least privilege, allowing full access to resources. 
2. CloudTrail was not set up and configured.
3. Loadbalancer is being configured and listening on HTTP with port 80, it should be configure with HTTPS
4. Security groups allow unrestricted access to ports with high risk which violates the AWS recommendation.
5. A lot of UDP/TCP ports are reachable from the internet on the EC2 instance such as: 20, 21, 23 80, 5000 etc,.
6. Server-side encryption/descryption and logging was not enabled for AWS S3 Buckets

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
1. Set up configure IAM policies with the right way for IAM root and IAM user. 
2. Apply virtual and/or hardward MFA on IAM user, IAM group user as well as configure previlege IAM role, IAM policy makes sense.
2. Create a CloudTrail for tracking on S3.
3. Application Load Balancer should be configured to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS
4. Limit the Ingres/Egress traffic on the Security Groups only allow 80 and 443 as well as reference the other security group for accessing AWS resource within VPC.
5. Disable all other non-necessary ports on the EC2 instance.
6. Enable S3 server-side encryption/descryption and logging
